There is no best tool to measure MV and unification of tools is still
an open question (Caballero et al. 2014; Wijnants et al. 2009)
which lead me:

\begin{itemize} 
\item  \bf{(i) to explore different methods of nonlinear dynamics to quantify

\item  \bf{(ii) to understand their strengths and weaknesses with

\begin{eqnarray*}
